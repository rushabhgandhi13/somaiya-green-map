 <h1>THE BIODIVERSITY GADERN</h1>  
 <p> Somaiya biodiversity garden- Spread on a 10,000 square feet area, this is the largest garden developed within any campus in the city. The garden has a small artificial pond, birdbath and bird homes to attract a variety of species. It also hosts nectar plants to attract butterflies. This is an initiative to develop an urban green ecosystem that portrays the co-existence of flora and fauna.</p>

        <label>Rain water harvesting</label>
        <p>A Rain Water Harvesting system was implemented in June 2010 across the Somaiya Vidyavihar Campus. Every year the campus reuses approximately one crore litres of rainwater from the catchments area, also considerable rainwater is being recharged. We hope to harvest 5.5 crore litres of rainwater this year across campus. The water thus stored will supplement the growing requirement of non-potable water in the campus.

The project was initiated in June 2010 and it is being implemented on an ongoing basis. Every day around 200 to 250 kilos of wet waste is produced on campus and we have 8 compost pits of about 200 square meters. The Vermiculture project has ensured proper disposal of garbage and recycling of waste. .....

 <h1>Green Souls</h1>  
 <p> 
  To sensitize children about our environment and the planet, an organization called "Green Souls" conducted an enthusiastic and eye opening session with the children of  Somaiya School

  They actively involved children in addressing environmental, health and community issues by practicing sustainable urban farming in Mumbai.
  
  There organic farms are setup to benefit the least privileged people in society by giving them access to healthy uncontaminated food, nature therapy and life skills training.
  
  With volunteer support, previously unused spaces are cleaned- up and nurtured by converting tonnes of organic 'waste' into nutrient rich compost for growing food. This improves environmental health and creates habitats for biodiversity in urban areas at the same time.
  
  Our aims are to bring more citizens together, to further develop innovative ways of growing food with least amount of resources and bring smiles into the community, for a more sustainable, healthy future for both society and our planet.

    <h1>Centre for Sustainable Development</h1>
    <p>

 <h1>Wind energy</h1>  
 <p> 
 The bhaskaracharya building of the k.j.college of engineering has a windmill instaled.
 The electricity generated by a wind turbine is represented by the turbine’s power curve. The power curve, which is unique for each turbine model, represents how much power the turbine will produce at a given wind speed.
 The V164 has a cut in speed of 4 meters per second (m/s), a rated power output of 8 MW at 13 m/s and a cut out speed of 25 m/s. Using the power curve, you can see that this turbine generates 4MW of power at a wind speed of 9 m/s. </p>

      In an attempt to raise awareness about the importance of e-waste management, Parvaah has decided to install e-waste bins in the college premises. This will go a long way in the proper disposal of hazardous e-waste, which forms the major constituent of junk in our college.

 <h1>Making the best use of solar energy</h1>  
 <p> 
  The solar project at K.J Somaiya college of Science and Commerce within the Somaiya Campus is a 50 Kw flat-roof solar photovoltaic system development and initiated by NMS solar company. Aluminum mounting structures were used to build during the initial stages of construction of solar panels. Concrete blocks were cast to mount the entire 200 solar panel system. Moreover,Solar web monitoring system was  made to show the daily, monthly as well as yearly production values. It is a touch screen user friendly device which even shows the environmental contribution as a vital feature . Proper earthing has been provided to all electronic central systems.
Thus, we can say that this solar project is a praiseworthy green initiative at the Somaiya Campus since it drastically reduces the carbon emission in the surrounding environment </p>

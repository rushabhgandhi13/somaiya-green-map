  <h1>Somaiya Vidyavihar starts a 'Green Club'</h1>
  <p>  
    College of Science
    The Club, under the guidance of the Department of Environmental Science is a student-based group committed to sustainability initiatives on campus. The Club was inaugurated by Nobel Peace prize winner Dr John Byrne, Director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy (CEEP) and Distinguished Professor of Energy and Climate Policy at the University of Delaware, who spoke to the students on 'Climate Change and Need for Sustainable Energy'. Green Club will begin with installing energy conserving techniques like solar bulbs and panels, Colour coded dustbins around the campus to promote and enhance the Vermicompost unit, formation of an Organic Garden, planning and establishing a Biodiversity park/garden for the students. Speaking on the launch Dr John Byrne, Director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy (CEEP) and Distinguished Professor of Energy and Climate Policy at the University of Delaware Said "I feel pleased to see the students of various departments, like management, engineering, arts, science commerce, who have joined this in conversation today. We are all coming to have a thoughtful interaction about a problem which is between all of us.
All of us can identify various problems which exist today but the problem of climate change is unique and all of us can identify various aspects of it however without the rigorous works of science one would not have been able to identify this problem. Each person has a special responsibility as we have received the investment of our society to try and understand our problems in a systematic way and climate change is one of those that require our attention.

    Water harvesting is a broad term covering the various techniques to collect rainwater from natural terrains or modified areas and concentrating it for use on smaller sites or cultivated fields to assure economic crop yields. This is basically designed to provide supplemental or life saving irrigation to crops, especially during the periods of moisture stress. Dry land orchard crops, mulberry and vegetable crops can be grown for higher income and more sustainability in production. For efficient application of irrigation water, it is feasible to adopt either sprinkler or drip irrigation methods so that extensive area could be brought under irrigation for the same quantity of water. Farm ponds also greatly help in sediment collection, which contain valuable plant nutrients. The collected silt could be best used as a source of plant nutrient to the crops grown in dry lands. This kind of nutrients harvesting for re use for crop production is useful when the rainfall intensity is very high causing sufficient runoff for storage, erratic seasonal distribution of rains resulting in long dry spells and to raise the high value long duration crops with protective irrigation. The water can also be harvested to recharge the ground water through the percolation ponds in a sequence on drainage line.
    
    Our approach
    
    Active involvement of farmers in the project with marginal contribution of expenses
    Supplementation of technical know how, training, submission of projects to obtain grants from various public agencies and also take part in expenditure of the project by davari Biorefineries Ltd.
    Motivate vt. agencies to participate in this programme

    <h1>Integrated approach in environmental education by each of our institutes.</h1>
    <p>
      In recent years, there has been increasing recognition of the importance of education for addressing environmental issues. Environmental Education enables students and the various stakeholders in the community to develop the necessary experience and skills needed to find solutions.

      With our commitment to the environment and as an academic institution, we take our role in building capacity in environmental education seriously.
      
      On World Environment Day, we share some of the courses by our various institutes. We are proud of the initiatives and integrated approach in environmental education by each of our institutes.
